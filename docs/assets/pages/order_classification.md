# Order Classification

A classification problem was also set up from the given data, this
section provides an overview of the models used and the results
obtained.

Each order was assigned a postal code based on Google map's
reversegeocode API that allows to estimate the location of an entity
given a point (lattitude, longitude).

Orders where the VENUE and USER share a common postal code is assigned
the class IN to imply the order has originated from the
code. Otherwise a class OUT is assigned to an order to indicate the
ORDER is received from outside the postal code. The table below
indicates most orders tend to originate outsided a postal code region,
the class imbalance is significant.

|	| IN | OUT |
|:------|:---|:----|
| ORDERS| 3983 | 14446 |
| (%)   | 21.6%| 78.4% |

A further evaluation of the averages of various features when
stratified by these classes indeed does indicate order that are out
the the postal region tend to be 1.15Km away while those within a
postal region tend to be 500 meters away.

|   FEATURE   	      | IN (mean) | OUT (mean)|
|:--------------------|:----------|:----------|
| EST_ACT_Diff		     | -1.075320  | -1.242697 |
