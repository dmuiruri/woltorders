# Data Overview

This section investigates the relationships between features and the
individual characteristics of the variables of interest.

## Correlations

The matrix of correlations between variables indicates that most
variables have low correlations, meaning no structural causality can
be generated variables in their current form.

The image below shows the scatter plots of individual variables
against each other. As the scatter plots show, most variables do not
have a strong linear relationship among each other. Additionally, the
KDE plots show characterisitcs of the variables, only the EST_ACT_Diff
shows signs of a normal distributions while others have non-normal
distributions.

## Distributions plots of Key Variables

The distribution of USER_VENUE_DIST shows that the average distance
between users and venue is about 1Km (1.02), the plot also shows a
tendancy to have distances that are further than 2Kms. ITEM_COUNT
distribution shows that orders with 1 item are dominant (average 2.6
items), interestingly, some orders may though rare may have more than
4 items. The EST_ACT_Diff variable represents the difference in
minutes between estimated time for a delivery and the actual time it
takes for the delivery to be completed. The distribution is
interestingly almost centered around zero (-1.2) but also shows signs
of under/over estimation of the time required to deliver the meals.
