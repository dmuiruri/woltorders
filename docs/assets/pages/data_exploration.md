# Data Overview

This section investigates the relationships between features and the
individual characteristics if variables of interest.

## Correlations

The matrix of correlations between variables indicates that most
variables have low correlations, meaning no structural causality can
be generated variables in their current form.

The image below shows the scatter plots of individual variables
against each other, this plot visually presents the correlations.
